<!-- As I looked at the washed-out image of a mufti sitting in front of a bookcase of Islamic literature, I couldn't help but notice how luminous the picture seemed. Sure, the camera quality wasn't great, but with that attitude in that moment I was noticing the light.

![Bookshelf](/bookshelf.jpg)

No doubt, it also had something to do with those shiny Arabic words, emblazoned in golden lettering, so intricately shaped and connected on the covers of those books.

How curious, though, that this computer screen in front of me was emitting the light that caught my eyes. What an _engineered_ technology, suspended in a house that sheltered me. And these eyes were there to catch this light, sitting in this body that supports them. What are the chances of all this happening? It was as though it were meant to be. You might say it's moments like these that justify belief in a divine architect.

But for all the wonder a sight like this might rouse, it's all suspended on one jugular vein.

What a delicate balance ...

And as such, if I were to have insisted on the beauty of this image, on taking pleasure in this moment, I would have lost the plot. For as swiftly as this image came to me, as swiftly as this train of thoughts passed through my mind, perhaps even more swiftly that jugular could be cut in twain, and that sight, that curiosity, that appreciation could all be snatched away.

A fragile world, isn't it? Whatever to do about it?

“Bhikkhus, I was delicately nurtured, most delicately nurtured, extremely delicately nurtured. At my father’s residence lotus ponds were made just for my enjoyment: in one of them blue lotuses bloomed, in another red lotuses, and in a third white lotuses. I used no sandalwood unless it came from Kāsi and my headdress, jacket, lower garment, and upper garment were made of cloth from Kāsi. By day and by night a white canopy was held over me so that cold and heat, dust, grass, and dew would not settle on me.

“I had three mansions: one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. I spent the four months of the rains in the rainy-season mansion, being entertained by musicians, none of whom were male, and I did not leave the mansion. While in other people’s homes slaves, workers, and servants are given broken rice together with sour gruel for their meals, in my father’s residence they were given choice hill rice, meat, and boiled rice.

(1) “Amid such splendor and a delicate life, it occurred to me: ‘An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to old age, not exempt from old age, feels repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when he sees another who is old, overlooking his own situation. Now I too am subject to old age and am not exempt from old age. Such being the case, if I were to feel repelled, humiliated, and disgusted when seeing another who is old, that would not be proper for me.’ When I reflected thus, my intoxication with youth was completely abandoned.

(2) “Again, it occurred to me: ‘An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to illness ... When I reflected thus, my intoxication with health was completely abandoned.

(3) “Again, it occurred to me: ‘An uninstructed worldling, though himself subject to death ... When I reflected thus, my intoxication with life was completely abandoned.

“There are, bhikkhus, these three kinds of intoxication. What three? Intoxication with youth, intoxication with health, and intoxication with life. (1) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with youth, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. (2) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with health, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. (3) An uninstructed worldling, intoxicated with life, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.

“Intoxicated with youth, a bhikkhu gives up the training and reverts to the lower life; or intoxicated with health, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life; or intoxicated with life, he gives up the training and reverts to the lower life.

“Worldlings subject to illness,
old age, and death, are disgusted
by other people who exist
in accordance with their nature.

“If I were to become disgusted
with beings who have such a nature,
that would not be proper for me
since I too have the same nature.

“While I was dwelling thus,
having known the state without acquisitions,
I overcame all intoxications—
intoxication with health,
with youth, and with life—
having seen security in renunciation.

“Zeal then arose in me
as I clearly saw nibbāna.
Now I am incapable
of indulging in sensual pleasures.
Relying on the spiritual life,
never will I turn back.” -->
